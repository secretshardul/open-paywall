                        <h1>NASA receives first weather reports from Perseverance rover on Mars at Jezero Crater</h1>

                        <p>Earlier this week, the NASA Perseverance rover reported on the weather from Mars’s Jezero
                            Crater for the first time,
                            providing an invaluable data set that will augment scientific understanding of the Martian
                            atmosphere and inform future
                            decisions about the rover’s mission.

                            The weather data will also help mission scientists decide when to launch Ingenuity, a
                            drone-like helicopter, that’s set
                            to take flight as early as Sunday.

                            NASA’s Perseverance rover may unlock mysteries behind weather on Mars

                            Perseverance, which was launched from Earth on July 30, arrived on the Red Planet in
                            mid-February and has been exploring
                            the Martian surface and collecting various types of data.

                            Among them is weather data, which scientists say will better shape what we know about
                            radiative processes and the cycle
                            of water in Mars’s atmosphere. There isn’t much of it, but water trapped beneath solid
                            carbon-dioxide ice caps at the
                            poles can be vaporized during the summertime and enter the atmosphere. Part of the plan with
                            Perseverance is to unlock
                            clues about what happens after.

                            Perseverance is in Mars’s Jezero Crater, a site NASA chose for the rover’s landing thanks to
                            its wide expanses, free of
                            obstacles, and the presence of a dried-up river delta from 3.5 billion years ago.

                            On Saturday and Sunday, the rover’s Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer, or MEDA, reported
                            a high temperature of
                            minus-7.6 degrees, and a low of minus-117.4 degrees. That rivals the coldest temperature
                            measured on Earth — minus-128.6
                            degrees observed at the Vostok weather station in Antarctica on July 21, 1983.

                            At least the winds on Mars were comparatively tepid, gusting to only 22 mph. But imagine
                            that wind chill …

                            The MEDA probes for temperature at four different levels — the surface, 2.76 feet, 4.76 feet
                            and 98.43 feet. While
                            barely touching the surface of the lower atmosphere, the MEDA is expected to help offer
                            insight into Mars’s radiation
                            budget. In other words, scientists will learn how sunlight striking the surface is
                            transformed into heat that enters and
                            cycles through the atmosphere.</p>
